0. I make, I exist.
1. The world is full of fascinating problems, which are waiting for solution.
2. The solving of a fascinating problem is more addictive than political power, sex or food.
3. The big ideas belong to those who implemented them.
4. All can become better, simpler, cheaper.
5. Wealth and social recognition are sad substitutes for recognition by ourself or our own kind.

7. Boredom and careless work drive to mediocrity, freedom and enthusiasm to creation.
8. Show off attitude does not substitute ability.

10. The power of deceit and destruction can only fascinate the mediocre and weak.
