#Arithmetic Operators
+,-,*,/,//,%
#Value Assignment Operators
=
+=,-=,*=,/= (x=x+1,x=x-1,x=x*1,x=x/1)
#Bitwise Operators (We'll deal with them much later)
& (bitwise and)
| (bitwise or)
^ (bitwise xor)
~ (not)
<< (shift left)
>> (shift right)
#Relational Operators
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
>,<,>=,<= (greater than, less than,
greater than or equal to, less than or equal to)
Compare two numbers or two strings
Return True/False
Especially for strings it is considered
that lowercase letters are lexicographically bigger
than CAPITALs
if letters is None:
#Logical Operators
and (logical and) : Returns True if both expressions/statements are True
or (logical or) : Returns True if at least one expression/statement is True
not (logical not) : Returns the reverse value of the expression/statement
They operate on logical variables!
-----------------------------------
Priority of operations
Arithmetic Operators > Relational Operators > Logical Operators

Note: The precedence of logical operators is:
- or (lowest priority)
- and
- not (highest priority)
