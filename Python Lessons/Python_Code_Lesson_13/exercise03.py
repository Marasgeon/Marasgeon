# Exercise 3:
# Define 2 complex numbers, add them together, and print the result.
# Then multiply them and print the result.
# Also notice the conjugate() method that returns the conjugate of the complex number.
x = 1 + 5j
y = 2 + 2j
z = x + y
print(z)
z = x * y
print(z)
print(x.conjugate())
