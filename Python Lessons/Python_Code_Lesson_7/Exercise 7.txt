Exercise 7.1: Memory Game with Cards

In the well-known memory card game:
- We are given a set of face-down cards, shuffled
- The cards are diads, i.e. every two cards have the same thing.
- The player chooses two cards, turns them face up and:
- If they are the same, he leaves them face up.
- If they are different, he closes them again.

Start the construction by defining a list, length 8, which will be containing 2 times the numbers 1,2,3,4
- Place the numbers in random order
- for now, the shuffling of the numbers is done in a pinch (hard-coded), later we will learn how to initialize it randomly.


Exercise 7.2: Current status list

Define a separate list showing the current state
of the game. Choose a coding of the items so that
to reflect the user's guesses:
- Show which cards are face down.
- Show which cards are face up.
- Show which cards are temporarily open.

Exercise 7.3: Guessing

Extend the program so that the player iterates:
- Selects 2 positions (must be from 0 to 7 and the
the corresponding cards must be face down)
- Print the current state with both cards face up.
- If they are the same, they stay open, otherwise they are closed again. Until all cards are face up, at which point the game ends.
Give functionality, with appropriate messages to the player.

Exercise 7.4: Number of attempts (score)

Extend the program to count the number of of the player's attempts(scores) :
- At the end of the game, display how many attempts the player has made.
