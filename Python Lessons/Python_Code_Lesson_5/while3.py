# Example while 3
# We usually use this value
# in our calculations
i = 0
while i <= 4:
    print(2*i+1)
    i += 1

# Terminology:
# - Initialization command (i=0)
# - Condition (i<=4)
# - Increment step (i+=1)

# In this code we output odd numbers.
# What would be the change in the code
# to output the even numbers.
